conv_diff

savepoints
nsave_points

savepoint init in write_data
write_data called from solver

savepoint written in main.c in write_data

!!! change to include conc data

processing of conv_diff will need to take place in rhs.cconvection_diffusion.c

Conv_Diff_IC??  initial condition, don't do it here.

if( nvert[k][j][i]>1.5) {   //Solid nodes common command for all
